### Summary
--

Who does not take out their phone to scroll mindlessly when bored? Reflection is a web application that lets users select a random piece of art from the Met Museum collection to focus on the art rather than social media, and jot down their thoughts on the piece (author, period, etc). This project is inspired from the New York Times monthly art 10 minutes challenge (https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/10-minute-challenge)

### Description
--

As a registered user, access the (almost) entire collection of paintings, coins, and other artefacts of the MET museum. The main feature of Muse is "Art Surprise." Instead of mindlessly scrolling through your phone, or doomscrolling the internet, randomly explore the MET's painting collection, discover new artwork, and enjoy unexpected momenent of exploration and reflection.

With Muse, save your mindful reflections, revisit your favorite artwork at your leisure, search for your favorite painter, sculptor, or era, or scrolls through the wonders of the MET's numerous departments and their artefacts.
