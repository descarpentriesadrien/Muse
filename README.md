# MUSE

#### Video Demo:
#### Description:

Who does not take out their phone to scroll mindlessly when bored? Reflection is a web application that lets users select a random piece of art from the Met Museum collection to focus on the art rather than social media, and jot down their thoughts on the piece (author, period, etc). This project is inspired from the New York Times monthly art 10 minutes challenge (https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/10-minute-challenge)

## Proposal

### Description

The user can register/login into the application. Once on the homepage, there are two choices: Get a random art piece, or check a previously seen art piece. If the user select "get a random art piece," they are led to another page which contains a picture of an art piece (thanks to the MET API) and a timer. The piece can be observed for as long as the user wants on a responsive element (zoom in, out, drag around), and when finished, they can answer some questions and jot down some thoughts on the piece they just observed, or even "like" the art. These answers are created in a database which can be accessed by the user if they decide to "check previous art piece." Each record will contain the time the user took on the painting, the answer to the questions (guess the painter, guess the period etc) and the actual answers. Another page provides information such as "longest observed art piece," or "most liked artist" etc.
